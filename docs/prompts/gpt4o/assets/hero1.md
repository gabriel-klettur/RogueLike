# Step 1. Create prompt with description of the character.


# Step 2. Replace [DIRECTION] with the desired direction (e.g., "up", "down", "left", "right").

Create a 2D pixel art sprite of the same medieval adventurer in an idle/resting pose, facing [DIRECTION], centered on a transparent background, with a resolution of exactly 64x64 pixels. The character wears a brown helmet, a green tunic, and brown boots. He holds a wooden shield in his left hand and a steel sword in his right hand. Keep the style consistent with classic 16-bit RPGs, using clean outlines and earthy tones. The sprite must be usable in a top-down RPG roguelike. Do not include background, shadow, or scenery.



# ----- TEST -----------
Create a professional-quality 2D pixel art spritesheet for use in a real top-down RPG roguelike video game. The spritesheet must be exactly 512x64 pixels and contain 8 idle/resting poses of the same medieval adventurer character, aligned horizontally. Each frame must be 64x64 pixels and centered in its space.

The character must always keep the same posture and proportions, changing only the direction they face. The order of directions from left to right is: DOWN, UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN-LEFT, DOWN-RIGHT, UP-LEFT, UP-RIGHT.

Design the character with a brown helmet, green tunic, brown boots, and earthy tones. He holds a wooden shield in his left hand and a steel sword in his right hand. The style must match high-quality 16-bit pixel art found in classic RPGs like Chrono Trigger or Zelda: A Link to the Past, with clean outlines, proper shading, and consistent lighting.

The background must be fully transparent with no scenery or shadows. Ensure that this asset is clean, game-ready, and consistent across all 8 directions.
